# Collaboard - Brainstorm creatively!

![landing](http://i.imgur.com/A61YyuA.jpg)

Collaboard combines the incredibly convenient asynchronous nature of chat, with the imaginativeness of a whiteboard.

## Features

Collaboard puts collaboration first. With a click of a button, your group/team can have your very own Collaboard without needing to log in.

With a Collaboard you can chat about and visualize your ideas in real time.

We sync your drawings and chat so you can freely come and go from your Collaboard as you please and not miss a thing.

Wanna save one of your ideas? No problem! You can also save snapshots of your drawings and download them at any time.
